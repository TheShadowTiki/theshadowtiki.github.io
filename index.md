**Barry Goldwater Scholar | B.S. Computer Engineering & B.A. Mathematics**  
Researcher at University of South Florida  
Former Undergraduate Research Fellow, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

## Research Focus

I study the algorithmic theory of neural circuits, seeking to bridge the gap between low-dimensional neural manifolds and mechanistic spiking neural network (SNN) substrates. My goal is to understand how circuit topology and dynamics give rise to flexible cognitive functions like decision-making and latent state inference.
